Mission: Deepen the overall liquidity of Indian markets

India is poised to grow into the next global tech superpower but the market liquidity is still very poor, compared to US & China.

A one-stop, tech-enabled, data-driven alternatives platform for global investors to invest in India. 

NOT A TRADING APPLICATION. WE ARE A FINTECH COMPANY FOCUSED ON BRINGING LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS INTO INDIA.

A wide range of asset classes (liquid & illiquid) for both retail & institutional investors. 

Safe & Secure

Proactive regulatory compliance with full transparency and risk management best practices

Build financial instruments & investment strategies (focused on India) for clients as well

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: BS & BR & GIC want to expand Indian portfolio but currency depreciation is a huge issue that affects returns. We believe the INR will gain against the USD in the long run, reducing the risk in Indian financial instruments.

- Focus on building 1 thing at a team : ETFs, crypto ETFs, leveraged India ETFs
- Personalized portfolios + recommendations
- Allow retail investor access to alternatives ; IndiaVest takes a signficant position in a particular fund. Break it's private stake into small units to sell to investors with smaller pool of funds.
- API Access for algorithmic traders to improve liquidity
